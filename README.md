# Immigration raids in London, 2014-2019

A **work in progress** choropleth of London postcode districts (e.g. E17), weighted by both number of immigration raids since 2014, and also optionally by immigration raids per 1,000 residents.

_**Data source**: immigration raid data from FOIs submitted by Haringey Anti-Raids and others in the anti-raids network; population counts from 2011 census data._

_**Tools used**: Python, with Folium and Geopandas packages._

Hat tip to walk-throughs from [AutoGIS](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/Lesson5-interactive-map-folium.html), and [Folium's clear documentation](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/quickstart.html#Choropleth-maps).
